/*
 * What is IIFE?
 * IIFE is an acronym for Immediately Invoked Function Expressions.
 * You declare a function and then immediately invoke it.
 * Why do we need it and what is the use?
 * The primary reason to use an IIFE is to obtain data privacy. 
 * Because JavaScript's var scopes variables to their containing function, any variables declared within the IIFE cannot be accessed by the outside world.
 * advantage : doesn't take name in function name space.
