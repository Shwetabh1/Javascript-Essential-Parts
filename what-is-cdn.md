A CDN shortens the path information has to travel between the server and user. A CDN is a network of servers, rather than a single server, with locations in multiple geographic locations. When a user accesses a website, information is pulled from the server location closest to them.

The result is a faster flow of data.

Files that can be hosted on a CDN include images, stylesheets, JavaScript, video and audio files, web fonts and other file formats (HTML, PDF, PPT, ZIP and more). The rule of thumb is that anything saved in the WordPress wp-content and wp-include folders can be stored in a CDN.


Moreover A CDN is designed for scalability so that you can handle changes in traffic (up or down) with ease and without learning of a traffic change because of a website that’s no longer functioning.


Advantage:
Because of faster loading speed and performance, a CDN can also improve your search engine rankings and optimization. (That’s a great added bonus!)

Note: Latency refers to the period of time it takes to send a request from a device to the server, for the server to process the request, and for the server to respond to the device (also referred to as round trip time). Round trip time (RTT) is measured in milliseconds and is an important metric in evaluating the performance of a network connection.
