//1. What is closure
/* 
 * Closures are functions that have access to the outer (enclosing) function's variablesâ€”scope chain even after the outer function
 * has returned.
 * A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared.
 * The word "lexical" refers to the fact that lexical scoping uses the location where a variable is declared within the source code to determine where that variable is available.
 * Remember it this way. Closure is nothing but a function with preserved data.
 */

//example 1 of closure
function add(num) {
    var n1 = num;
    return function add2(n2) {
        console.log(n1 + n2);
        return n1 + n2;
    }
}

var addN = add(5);
addN(5);

//example 2 of closure
var Employee = function(name, company, salary) {
    var name = name; //Public attribute default value is null
    var company = company; //Public attribute default value is null
    var salary = salary; //Public attribute default value is null

    // Private method
    var increaseSalary = function(salary) {
        salary = salary + 1000;
    };

    // Public method
    var dispalyIncreasedSalary = function() {

        console.log(salary);
    };
    return { increaseSalary: increaseSalary, dispalyIncreasedSalary: dispalyIncreasedSalary };
};

var e = new Employee("san", "cdi", 5000);
e.increaseSalary(1000);
e.dispalyIncreasedSalary();


/*
 * Anytime you try to access anything from outside the scope it becomes a closure.
 * You can easily understand the above example using lexical scoping.
 * The word "lexical" refers to the fact that lexical. 
 * scoping uses the location where a variable is declared within the source code to determine where that variable is available.

// 2. Why would you use one ?
/*
-> Data privacy / closures are commonly used to give objects data privacy. 
-> Partial applications or currying. e.g when you get some parameter later
-> Closures are mostly used in callbacks, such as timeouts, event handlers, and so on, as well as in modules.
*/

//EXAMPLE 1 Data Privacy
function create() {
    var counter = 0;
    return {
        increment: function() {
            counter++;
        },
        print: function() {
            console.log(counter);
        }
    }
}
var c = create();
c.increment();
c.print(); // 1

//EXAMPLE 3 print 1 to 5 and use setTimeout in it.
function closureDummy(n) {
    var num = n;
    setTimeout(function() {
        console.log(num);
    }, 3000);
}

function dummyPromise() {
    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
        setTimeout(function() {
            console.log('After 3 seconds');
            resolve();
        }, 3000)
    })
}
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    closureDummy(i);
}

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    dummyPromise().then(function() {
        console.log('What am I doing??');
    })
}

//3. How does it work internally ?
/*
 * First off, JavaScript has lexical scoping with function scope.
 * In other words, even though JavaScript looks like it should have block scope because it uses curly braces { }, a new scope is created only when you create a new function.
 * 
 * The scope of variables is defined by their position in source code.
 * In order to resolve variables, JavaScript starts at the innermost scope and searches outwards until it finds the variable it was looking for.
